I'm interested in solving the problems it takes to bring intelligent machines into every day life; I'm experienced in, or otherwise passionate about multi-agent systems, path/motion-planning, human-robot interaction, and high-level mission planning. 

Currently, I'm working on the future of robotic surgery at Neocis Inc, where I work as a software engineer. In the past, I've had the opportunity to work on unmanned underwater vehicles at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Panama City, FL and autonomous cars at the Volkswagen ERL in Belmont, CA. 


I majored in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from Cornell University, Spring '15. I worked with extensively with Professor Hadas Kress-Gazit on formal methods and controller synthesis. 


####Coursework Highlights:

- "robotics": Formal Methods, Robotic Manipulation, Autonomous Mobile Robots, Mechatronics
- "mechanical:" Innovative Product Design, Mechanical Synthesis, Statics and Mechanics
- "computer science": Machine Learning, Computer System Organization, Data Structures

Drumming and filmmaking have always been big hobbies of mine. I was privileged to be a part of [Yamatai](http://yamatai-taiko.com/), Cornell's one and only Taiko Drumming group. Though I'm not working on any videos at the moment, I am always open to taking new projects.
