I'm interested in solving the problems it takes to bring intelligent machines into every day life; specifically, I would work with multi-agent systems, path/motion-planning, decision-making, and human-robot interaction. 

Currently, I'm working on the future of robotic surgery at Neocis Inc, where I work as a software developer. In the past, I've had the opportunity to work on intelligent UUV's at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Panama City, FL and autonomous cars at the Volkswagen ERL in Belmont, CA. 


I majored Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from Cornell University, Spring '15. I worked with extensively with Professor Hadas Kress-Gazit on formal methods and controller synthesis. 


*Coursework Highlights:*

- "robotics": formal methods, robotic manipulation, autonomous mobile robots, mechatronics
- "mechanical:" Innovative product design, Mechanical Synthesis, Statics and Mechanics
- "computer science": Machine Learning, computer system organization, data structures

###some robots i've worked with
- Aldebran Nao
- iRobot Create
- Baxter
- Audi Rs7
